					With a prelimiary analysis,
					we were able to understand that our data was
					primarily about Champaign county, with some info
					about neighbouring counties (even in different states
					This plot shows a count of transactions
					per county, and we have data about 6306
					transactions in Champaign

					This plot helps us understand
					how average unit costs varied by county.
					While most counties fall within an average unit cost range,
					some counties like Clinton, Grundy and
					Hendricks (Indiana) have recorded
					the highest average unit costs

					This is a really interesting plot as, when you hover over a point, it shows you  
					the name of the merchant with that average unit cost. With this, it becomes easy 
					to analyze which merchant brand is charging a higher premium in a specific 
					location.
					This also helps understand whether
					a relationship exists between number of transactions
					and unit cost for a brand to see if more transactions
					attracted brand to charge a higher price.
					That assumption did turn out to be true as some brands have been seen to
					charge a higher premium based on their popularity.
